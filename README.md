# K_DAE_Pytorch
Pytorch implementation of the paper "K-Autoencoders Deep Clustering"

This is a repository for the K_DAE deep learning network. The entire project is not well prepared for object oriented and need more modifications. 

However, it implements the Pytorch version of the K_DAE, developed for those who are not familiar Keras and TensorFlow. 

During the implementation, some activation functions and loss functions are modified.

To run the model, use `fit()` in `Train_Model()`.
